# Rust minigrep

- grep is a command-line utility for searching plain-text data sets for lines that match a regular expression. Its name comes from the ed command g/re/p, which has the same effect. grep was originally developed for the Unix operating system, but later available for all Unix-like systems and some others such as OS-9. <br>

## Usage 

````cargo run <query> <filename>```` <br>
you can also set environment variable ```CASE-SENSITIVE```  for case sensitive search
